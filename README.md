# Note-Taker

## Description

Notetaker is an application that was created in order to assist with taking notes and having somewhere to save them. These notes can also be removed if these tasks have been completed, etc. This project was built using references such as W3schools, other coders, and starter code. It was created in order to help people like myself who are forgetful.


## Installation

This application can be run using Express JS and Node JS.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running in your browser, all you need to do is add a title and description of your note, then click the save button in the top right hand corner, and it will allow you to save these notes. These notes are also able to be removed by selecting the trash icon next to your note.
